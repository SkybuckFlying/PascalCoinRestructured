**END OF AGREEMENT**

# Notes

These notes provide insight on areas of the Agreement but are **NOT** part of the Agreement itself.

## Clauses 5.6, 5.7, 5.8

The purpose of these clauses are to provide an economic incentive-model to motivate more efficient delivery and genuine contributions, whilst filtering out Proposals unlikely to deliver. In simplified terms, a Contractor is required to hold a percentage of what they're asking for in order to receive Payments. If they do not have this amount, then a 50% portion of their Payments are withheld in a holding account until such time that this Reserve can be met, then the full payments are made. The amount withheld during a Proposal is released to the Contractor on succesful delivery. On failure to deliver, the withheld amount is retained by the Foundation.

### Daily Payment Logic
```
Let TotalContractorPASC = Contractor Account Quantity + Contract Withheld Quantity
if TotalContractorPASC >= Reserve Ratio * Proposal Quantity then
   Contractor receives pull daily payment
else
   Contractor receives 50% of daily payment
   Contractor withholding account receives 50% of daily Payment
```

### Reserve Release Logic
```
If a Proposal is ACTIVE and Current Date >= Proposal.FinishDate then 
   Proposal is COMPLETED and Contractor receives the withheld amount
else
   Proposal is ABORTED and Foundation receives the withheld amount
```

The Foundation may intervene on a case-by-case basis, however (clause 5.8). 

### Benefits include:

* Provide an economic incentive for Contractors to deliver high-quality Works as efficiently as possible
* Provide an economic incentive for successful Proposal termination (rather than a Community Abort) since Contractor will receive "Bonus"-style payment on succesful completion
* Allow serious Contractors who already HODL PASC to bypass this requirement
* Not limit the pool of available talent to only holders of PASC, but anyone who wants to earn PASC
* Allow non-holders of PASC to participate in the PASC eco-system, but in a genuine and serious manner
* Allow non-holders of PASC to HODL PASC, teaching sound investment techniques likely to create community of evangelists who promote PASC as price orbits the moons of neptune.
* Filter out scammer and non-serious minor Proposals without requiring expensive community effort
* Automated filtering via this economic incentive model allows high-volume, high-frequency more granular proposals (spanning into the thousands and tens of thousands over time).
* Ensure large contracts are not awarded to Contractors who do not believe in PASC
* Ensure at least 10% of total PIP-0011 funds are always reserved in the supply
* Reserve can be used by Contractors for earning income by staking it on Layer-2 sidechains, both securing Layer-2 sidechains via Proof-of-Stake and earning income from this reserved capital (can be used in Layer-2 nodes)
* Facilitate highly-decentralised and well-capitalised Staker set securing non-federated Layer-2 sidechains (sidechains "not owned by anyone")
* Lowers supply-side liquidity on exchanges, adding slight upward price pressure for PASC
