## Summary

A new operation called MULTI-TRANSACTION is proposed that allows a transfer of funds from N accounts to M accounts within in a single operation. This will immediately provide DASH-level anonymity and serve as foundational component for subsequent full anonymity. 

## Motivation

Currently, PascalCoin transactions occur between publically visible accounts. Of all the cryptocurrencies, PascalCoin is the least anonymous. Anonymity is intrinsically connected to fungibility, a crucial aspect of any currency. Without fungibility, adoption will be stunted. This proposal immediately delivers DASH-level anonymity into the protocol, and will allow users to perform:

**Client-Server Mixing**

Use a web-driven mixer UI similar similar to how Bitcoin Cash transactions are mixed today (but not Bitcoin Core, due to high fees).

**Network-protocol Mixing**

As phase-2 of anonymity, the network protocol will be upgraded via soft-fork to support mixing directly between wallet-to-wallet, in a virtually seamless manner as sending a transaction now.

**Chaining Multi-Transactions**

Immediately and improved in phase-2, users will be able to chain multiple Multi-Transactions together delivering indecipherable complexity between transfers.

**Monetized-API Mixing**

As a CPU-mining community arises from [PIP-0009][1], those node operators will be able to earn extra income by running a **Layer-2 node** (similar to a Masternode in DASH), that can participate in totally secure phase-2 anon, among various other Layer-2 applications such as smart-contract and marketplace platforms.

## Specification

A new operation called MULTI-TRANSACTION is proposed as follows:

### New Operation: MULTI-TRANSACTION

- SenderCount: Word - number of sender accounts (N)
- SenderAccount_1: DWord - first sender account
- SenderQuantity_1: QWord - amount first sender is sending
- SenderNOperation: DWord - the new N_OPERATION value of first senders account

    .
    .
    .

- SenderAccount_N : DWord - N'th sender account
- SenderQuantity_N : DWord - amount N'th sender is sending
- SenderNOperation_N: DWord - the new N_OPERATION value of N'th senders account 
- RecipientCount: Word - number of recipient accounts (M)
- RecipientAccount_1: DWord - first recipient account
- RecipientQuantity_1 : QWord - amount first recipient is receiving

    .
    .
    .

- RecipientAccount_M : DWord - M'th recipient
- RecipientQuantity_M : QWord - amount M'th recipient is receiving
- SenderFee: network fee payable to miners **per sender**
- Payload: operation payload
- SenderSignature_1: signature of first sender

    .
    .
    .

- SenderSignature_N: signature of N'th sender

**Consensus Rules**
- Ensure fee per sender is non-zero
```
SenderFee > 0
```

- Ensure at least 1 sender
```
SenderCount > 0
```

- Ensure at least 1 recipient
```
RecipientCount > 0
```

- Ensure all senders have enough to send and pay fee
```
for-all s in Senders 
    SafeBox.Accounts[s.Account].Balance >= s.Quantity + SenderFee
```

- Ensure the amount being spent balances the amount being received
```
SUM( select Quantity from Senders ) = SUM( select Quantity from Recipients ) + Count( Senders ) * SenderFee
```

- Ensure the sender N_OPERATION values are correct 
```
for-all s in Senders
    s.NOperation = SafeBox.Accounts[s.Account].NOperation + 1
```

- Ensure that all senders sign the entire message **except the signature portion**
```
let signedPortion = select bytes from (SenderCount...Payload) of Multi-Transaction
for-all s in Senders    
    ECDSA_VerifySignature(s.Signature, signedPortion, SafeBox[s.Account].PublicKey) = True 
```

#### Segregated Signatures during OPHASH ###

In order to allow a sender to know the OPHASH of the Multi-Transaction before the **next sender** signs, it's important that the signature portion of the Multi-Transaction be omitted from the RIPEMD160-portion of the OPHASH calculation
```
OPHASH(MultiTransaction) = RIPEMD160 ( select bytes (SenderCount...Payload)  from MultiTransaction ) 
```

Otherwise it will not be possible for a Sender to determine the OPHASH until it finally reaches a block. This will break high-frequency mixing.

## Rationale

Other methods of anonymity are in development and will either rely or benefit from this proposal. As a result, implementing this PIP delivers an overwhelming gain for virtually zero costs. 

## Backwards Compatibility

This change is not backwards compatible and requires a hard-fork activation.
