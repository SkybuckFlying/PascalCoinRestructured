## History:  

### Build 1.4.2.0 - 2017-01-23

- Max JSON-RPC miner connections is now 1000 (before, 10)
- JSON-RPC miner enabled at pascalcoin_daemon (linux daemon)
- Screen messages for daemon
- pascalcoin_daemon.ini file for daemon

### Build 1.4.1.0 - 2017-01-18

- Improved JSON communications with Miner client (Port 4009 by default)
- Deleted adding numeration to JSON miner clients (only sends miner name)
- Minor changes

### Build 1.4.0.0 - 2016-12-30

- JSON-RPC changes:
  - Added method "signsendto" to allow a off-line wallet sign transaction operations without being syncrhonized
  - Added method "signchangekey" to allow a off-line wallet sign change key operations without being syncrhonized
  - Added method "executeoperations" to allow a on-line wallet execute operations signed off-line
  - Added method "operationsinfo" that will decode operations signed off-line
  - Added param "max" at JSON-RPC method "getblocks"
  - Changed param name "deep" for "depht" in "getaccountoperations". Deep will be available for compatibility.
  - Changed result for "changekeys". Now returns a "JSON operation object" array with each change key operation result
  - Changes on "JSON Operation object": May return a "valid" param and "errors" param
- Corrected a memory leak when processing JSON-RPC calls
- Better performance in connection protocol
- Updated protocol available to 1
- Updated net protocol to 3-4
- Important bug corrected

### Build 1.3.0.0 - 2016-11-24

- JSON-RPC modifications:
  - New param "b58_pubkey", can be used instead of "enc_pubkey": b58_pubkey is a Base58 encoded public key with checksum, is the value that Wallet exports/imports public key
  - New JSON object type Public Key: "name","can_use","enc_pubkey","b58_pubkey","ec_nid","x" and "y" for each public key
  - Added params "start" and "max" to "getaccountoperations". By default deep=100, max=100 and start=0, so will return last 100 operations made to an account
  - Added params "start" and "max" to "getblockoperations". By default max=100 and start=0, so will return last 100 operations made to a block
  - Added params "start" and "max" to "getwalletaccounts". By default max=100 and start=0, so will return first 100 accounts of the wallet
  - Added params "start" and "max" to "getwalletpubkeys". By default max=100 and start=0, so will return first 100 public keys of the wallet
    - Will return a Public key JSON object
  - Method "decodepubkey" allows params "enc_pubkey" or "b58_pubkey" (if used together, returns error if not match)
    - Will return a Public key JSON object
  - Method "changekey" allows params "new_enc_pubkey" or "new_b58_pubkey" (if used together, returns error if not match)
  - Method "getwalletaccounts" allows params "enc_pubkey" or "b58_pubkey" (if used together, returns error if not match)
  - Method "getwalletaccountscount" allows params "enc_pubkey" or "b58_pubkey" (if used together, returns error if not match)
  - Method "getwalletcoins" allows params "enc_pubkey" or "b58_pubkey" (if used together, returns error if not match)  
  - Method "payloadencrypt"  allows params "enc_pubkey" or "b58_pubkey" when payload_method="pubkey" (if used together, returns error if not match)  
  - Method "addnewkey" changed. Does not return an HEXASTRING with enc_pubkey, now returns a public key JSON object
  - New methods:
    - Method "changekeys". Similar to "changekey" but for multiple accounts at param "accounts" as a coma separated string (ex: "accounts"="1248,1753,85056"). Returns a JSON object with result information
    - Method "lock" to lock wallet. Returns true if locked, returns false if wallet has no password (an empty string, must put a new password prior to lock)
    - New method "getwalletpubkey". Search for "enc_pubkey" or "b58_pubkey" and returns a Public key JSON object
- Corrected a issue saving last 5 .bank files
- Improved protections for .bank corruption files
- Added "open data folder" button on options form
- Other minor changes

### Build 1.2.0.0 - 2016-11-16

- Account checksum values modified to be more easy and more distributed: Checksum = ((N * 101) MOD 89)+10
- Allow find operations by "ophash"
- Show Operation "ophash" in operation payload decoder
- Added param "enc_pubkey" to "getwalletaccounts" JSON-RPC method to return only accounts from this public key
- Added params "pow" and "sbh" to "nodestatus" JSON-RPC method
- Added method "getwalletaccountscount" returning accounts count of the entire wallet or for a single "enc_pubkey"
- Added method "getwalletcoins" returning coins of the entire wallet or for a signle "enc_pubkey"
- Modified seed nodes distribution to send only checked IP nodes
- Corrected invalid operation block index when showing account operations


### Build 1.1.0.0 - 2016-11-03

- Minor changes


### Build 1.0.9.0 - 2016-10-21
